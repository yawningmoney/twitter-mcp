# Twitter/X MCP Development Plan

## 1. Core Features

*   **Post Tweet:** Send a new tweet.
*   **Read Timeline:** Get tweets from a user's timeline.
*   **Search Tweets:** Search for tweets based on keywords.
*   **Send Direct Message:** Send a private message to a user.
*   **Follow/Unfollow User:** Manage relationships on the platform.
*   **Get User Profile:** Retrieve information from a specific profile.
*   **Scrape Tweet Information:** Extract detailed information from tweets, such as likes, retweets, and comments.
*   **Open Twitter Links:** Open a Twitter link in the browser.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze the sentiment of tweets.
*   **Trending Topics:** List the most talked about topics in a specific location.
*   **Interact with Tweets:** Like, retweet, and comment on tweets.
*   **Get Followers:** Get a user's followers.
*   **Get Following:** Get who a user is following.
*   **Get Klout Score:** Get the Klout score of a user.
*   **Twitter Login:** Authenticate with Twitter to get an access token.

## 2. Architecture

The MCP server will be built using TypeScript and Node.js, following the structure of the other MCPs analyzed. It will use the Twitter API for core functionalities, Firecrawl for scraping tweet information, and the Klout API for Klout scores.

## 3. Authentication

The server will require the following API keys. Only the Twitter API Key and Secret are mandatory.

*   **Twitter API Key (Required):** You can get this from the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).
*   **Twitter API Secret Key (Required):** You can get this from the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).
*   **Twitter Bearer Token:** You can get this from the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).
*   **Twitter User ID:** You can get this from your Twitter profile.
*   **Firecrawl API Key:** You can get this from the [Firecrawl website](https://firecrawl.dev/).
*   **Klout API Key:** You can get this from the [Klout website](http://klout.com/s/developers/home).

You can also use the `twitter_login` tool to authenticate with Twitter and get an access token.

## 4. Implementation Steps

1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new TypeScript project and install the necessary dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `axios`, `firecrawl`, `sentiment`, `open`, `ms`).
2.  **Authentication:** Implement the logic to authenticate with the Twitter API, Firecrawl API and Klout API using the provided credentials.
3.  **Tool Implementation:** Implement each of the core features as a separate tool in the MCP server.
4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage API errors and other potential issues.
5.  **Anti-Bot Detection:** Implement measures to avoid bot detection, such as using a custom user agent and adding random delays between requests.
6.  **Testing:** Create a test plan to ensure all tools are working as expected.
7.  **Documentation:** Write a comprehensive README file with installation instructions, a list of available tools, and usage examples.
